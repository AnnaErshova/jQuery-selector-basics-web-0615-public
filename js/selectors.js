	// example code:

	// selects the element with the class of special and add the class of pinky to it.
	$('.special').addClass('pinky');

	// selects the checked checkbox inuts and wraps tem with a span that has the class of pinky.
	$(":checked").wrap('<span class="pinky">');

	// Use jQuery selectors to select 5 different elements and highlight them by applying a class of pinky to them.
